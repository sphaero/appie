# Appie

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sphaero/appie.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sphaero/appie)

Appie is a simple static generator for dynamic websites. Dynamic websites? 
Yes! Although Appie can generate HTML files its focus is on providing all 
information of files residing in your website's directory. As a HTML file 
can not see what's available on your webserver Appie will provide a JSON 
file containing exactly this. From this the HTML file, using javascript, 
can figure things out. By matching to certain filenames the JSON file can 
be filled with specific data. For example a file with the .textile 
extension is parsed into HTML. Same holds for files ending with a .md 
extension.

Just point Appie to a directory and it will provide you with a JSON file 
with all of its contents and a static directory with all static files.

Files generated by Appie can be served on very simple webhosting servers. 
No PHP or other webserver modules are needed! It is also possible to host 
on github.io for example (Don't forget the .nojekyll file)

Appie parses files through extensions. Extensions are very easy to 
write. If a file or directory is not matched to an extension it will be 
copied to the target build directory.

## Installation

Just use Pip:

    pip install https://github.com/sphaero/appie/archive/master.zip

*Appie is developed for Python3! It might work on Python2 but please stop using Python2! Unittest are also only testing Python>3.3.*

## Extensions

The following extensions are available:

- \_\*: any file starting with an \_ will be loaded into the json
- \*.textile: html text entry in the resulting json file
- \*.png: converted to a thumbnail jpg (filename_thumb.jpg) and a jpg with a fixed dimension (filename.jpg)
- \*.jpg: converted to a thumbnail jpg (filename_thumb.jpg) and a jpg with a fixed dimension (filename.jpg) if the original image size is bigger than the set size

Some non default extensions:

- *.md.html: simple markdown file to html file parser matching on '.md.html' 
extensions. 
- blog/: a directory named blog will be parsed as a blog. Blog entries consist
of a markdown file (.md) containing metadata. The metadata will be fed to the 
blog.jinja2 file which generates static html files. The json will contain 
all blog entries and metadata. See below for an example

## Example

For example we have the following directory contents:

    ./files
    ./files/report_2008.pdf
    ./files/report_2009.pdf
    ./files/report_2010.pdf
    about.textile
    home.textile
    ./img/banner.png
    
Appie is run as follows:

    $ appie -s /path/to/directory

You will then have a new directory 'build' in your current direcyory with the following contents:

    ./build/files/report_2008.pdf
    ./build/files/report_2009.pdf
    ./build/files/report_2010.pdf
    ./build/img/banner_thumb.jpg
    ./build/img/banner.jpg
    ./build/img/banner.png
    ./build/all.json
    
The file 'all.json' will contain:

    { "home.textile" : "<h3>Test</h3><p>This is just a test</p>",
      "about.textile" : "<h3>About</h3><p>What about it</p>",
      "files": {"report2010.pdf": "/files", "report2009.pdf": "/files", "report2008.pdf": "/files"}
      "img" : { "banner.png": { "thumb" : "banner_thumb.jpg", "web": "banner.jpg", "path": "img"}}
    }
    
## Built-in webserver

For your development convenience Appie can also serve from the build directory. If you run appie with the -w flag it will serve the generated files through a HTTP server. By default this HTTP server runs on port 8000.

    $ appie -s /path/to/directory -w -p 8000
    Serving on port 8000...     press CTRL-C to quit
    
## Blog example

For example we have the following directory contents:

    ./blog
    ./blog/blog.jinja2
    ./blog/first_post.md
    ./blog/img/first.jpg
    
When Appie is run with the BlogParser:

    $ appie -s /path/to/directory -d AppieBlogParser
    
You will end up with the following build directory:

    ./build/blog/first_post.html
    ./build/blog/img/first_thumb.jpg
    ./build/blog/img/first_web.jpg
    ./build/blog/img/first.jpg
    ./build/all.json

The all.json file will contain the following:

    {
        "blog": {
            "first_post.html": {
                "tags": [ "tag1", "tag2" ],
                "title" : "First Post Evah",
                "summary" : "The usual bullshit",
                "date": "2016-11-04"
            },
            "img": {
                "first.jpg": { 
                    "thumb" : "first_thumb.jpg", 
                    "web": "first_web.jpg", 
                    "path": "blog/img"
                }
            }
        }
    }

The blog.md file contains:

    title:   First Post
    summary: A brief description of my document.
    Date:    2016-11-04
    tags: tag1, tag2

    First Post

    Hello world!

It's important to understand all meta data is fed into the jinja2 template.
